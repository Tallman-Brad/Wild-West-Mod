= WILD WEST MOD =
=================

The Wild West Mod rolls back time to around the Mid 19th Century Wild West America.
It attempts to remove features which are not time appropriate and introduce additional features to expand and complement the experience.

A few examples include:

- Only the 'Old West' type tiling system will appear when using the RWG, with age appropriate POIs.
- Asphalt has been replaced with gravel throughout the whole world.
- Cars assets have been overwritten with wagons. This continues to allow wrenching.
- Some items have been renamed such as electrics to connectors and given an appropriate icon.
- Weapons have been rolled back with customization and a return of the Hunting Rifle from earlier 7D2D builds.
- Age appropriate food items.
- Custom lighting, traps, vending machines, and other features.
- Hooked up for Telrics Horses.

There are an abundance of other changes that players will notice as gameplay commences.

The Wild West Mod is brought to you by the Tallman Brad Gameplay Community, with support from Guppy's Unofficial 7DtD Modding Server and community creators.
